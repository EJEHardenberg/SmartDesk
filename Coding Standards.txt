Coding Standards:

Braces should not waste verticle space:


	if(somefunction()){
		//...
	}

	do not do this:
	if(somefunction())
	{
		//...
	}


Function names should be camel case:
do: someReallyLongButRatherDescriptiveFunctionName()
do not: some_really_long_function_name()

Constants should be in all caps:
CONST CHAR * BACON = "I LOVE BACON"

Comments should be descriptive, and describe oddities in code or 
explain why an include is needed, etc.... no need to comment while
loops like: "this is a while loop bla"
