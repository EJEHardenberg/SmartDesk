Plan:

C for efficiency and solid code (release)
Java for prototyping new ideas quickly and dirty

Libraries needed to compile so far:
 build essential
 libsdl1.2debian & libsdl1.2-dev
 libsdl-image1.2 & libsdl-image1.2-dev


Data Structure for sending information:
 Larger objects are serialized
 Realtime point to point done by simpler things such as sending bytes

Initial thoughts for files:
 sending information for plotting points down should be done as minimally as possible. 
 Storing this information... ?
 Using SDL for openGL?
