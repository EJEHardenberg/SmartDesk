Plan:

C for efficiency and solid code (release)
Java for prototyping new ideas quickly and dirty

Data Structure for sending information:
 Larger objects are serialized
 Realtime point to point done by simpler things such as sending bytes

Initial thoughts for files:
 sending information for plotting points down should be done as minimally as possible. 
 Storing this information... ?
 Using SDL for openGL?
